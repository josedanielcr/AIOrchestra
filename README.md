## Introduction
AIOrchestra leverages a scalable and efficient event-driven architecture with microservices to deliver personalized song recommendations. It is built using .NET Core, Kafka, Docker, and TensorFlow, making it an ideal project for learning and practicing these technologies.

## Features
- **Microservice Architecture**: Independent, scalable services for different functionalities.
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Utilizes Kafka for asynchronous communication between services.
- **Machine Learning**: Custom-trained model with TensorFlow for generating song recommendations.
- **Docker**: Containerized services for consistent deployment and management.
- **Database Synchronization**: Decoupled services with their own databases and synchronization mechanisms.

## Technologies
- **.NET Core 8**: Framework for building microservices.
- **Kafka**: Event streaming platform for managing communication between services.
- **Docker**: Containerization for deployment consistency.
- **TensorFlow**: Machine learning framework for building and training the recommendation model.
